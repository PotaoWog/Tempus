# Tempus 
###Senior Project at Universidade Católica de Santos created by Otavio Tarelho and Diego Nunes

###What is Tempus?
  Tempus is an Android alarm clock which permit creation of alarm based on your calendar activities. The events imported from Google Calendar and any calendar apps let the app tells (through an alarm ringing) when is the best time to leave your current place to the event. 

###Why we made Tempus?
  Not being late in your daily activities if you live in a big city is a very difficult task. All streets and roads were taken by vehicles since many people are using these types of  transportation.  Also,  you  can  combine  to  the fact  the citizens’ agenda  have  daily events  in  very  remotes  parts  of  the  city,  sometimes  hours  away  from  their  current position. Being late is a problem that affects almost everyone who lives in an urban city, and the problems of being late can be even bigger in their personal or professional life.<br/>
  Thinking  about  these  facts,  it  was  created  this  Android  alarm  clock  application integrated with a maps service which helps estimate the expected time of arrival to a daily event place registered in the user’s calendar  or  selected  in the moment  of the alarm creation. The application, based on the ETA, can set the best ringing time to alert users that they need to leave to an appointment, all automatically.

###Why did we make the source code available?
  The main project objective was to create an application based on APIs integrations and check its viability on helping users on their daily tasks. We, the authors, when finishing this project had an agreement about the future of this project getting the conclusion that the best way to encourage new developers to create new solutions like ours is sharing what we have done.
  
##What does you need to know?
This application is free and need to keep this way. if you use this source code, please, refer us.<br/>
We didn't upload the final code of this application, so it has a lot of work to be done. For example, the alarm is not updating itself when it suppose to do.<br/>
